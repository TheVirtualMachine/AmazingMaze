You are the world's best ICS teacher, Ms. Krasteva. As a thank you gift for an amazing year of teacher, your students bought you a coffee. But when you drank the coffee, you started to feel funny.

When you got home, you turned on her TV, and started to watch the news. They were running a story on a coffee recall! Due to horrible quality control, coffee from [bad coffee place] was turning people sick. But not just a normal kind of sick. It was turning them into mice!

You see the world around you getting bigger, but it wasn't. Ms. Krasteva was turning into Mouse Krasteva!

The news wrapped up the story by mentioning that the company "Hip Hip Array" has been testing an antidote. However, you do not have time to wait for this antidote, because you need to mark the fantastic ISPs your students have poured the last month of their lives into in an effort to get 100%.

You take it upon yourself to break into the lab, and steal the antidote, since mice are unable to use computer mice...
