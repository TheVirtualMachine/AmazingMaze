	\chapter{The Story}
		You are the world's best ICS teacher, Ms. Krasteva. As a thank you gift for an amazing year of teaching, your students bought you a coffee. But when you drink the coffee, you start to feel funny.

		When you get home, you turn on your TV, and start to watch the news. They are running a story on a coffee recall! Due to horrible quality control, coffee from Starbucks is turning people sick. But not just a normal kind of sick. It is turning them into mice!

		You see the world around you getting bigger, but it isn't. Ms. Krasteva is turning into Mouse Krasteva!

		The news wrapped up the story by mentioning that the company "Hip Hip Array" is testing an antidote. However, you do not have time to wait for this antidote, because you need to mark the fantastic ISPs your students have poured the last month of their lives into in an effort to get 100%.

		You take it upon yourself to break into the lab, and steal the antidote, since mice are unable to use computer mice.

		Unfortunately for you, the lab has a high-tech security system of boolean algebra mazes and cat security guards, and you will have to not get electrocuted and collect fish to bribe the cats not to eat you.
